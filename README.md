# logitechOptionsK380ColorFix
Logitech messed up with its new LogiOptions+ Software and is not able to match the keyboard you are actually using to the software - so by default, it will always show the rose one. If you have Logi Options+ installed in its default location - just download the script for your keyboard and run it. 

It really does not matter where you place the file - it will automatically ask for admin permissions and change the name of the file LogiOptions+ uses to display the keyboard in the software.
I don't know why Logitech still has not fixed this but here you go - I made this script because you have to rename the file every time LogiOptions+ updates - so if you update yours - just run the script again and enjoy the right color of the keyboard :D 

PS: if you have changed the color once you can't run another script to change the color again (it's due to the way the script is currently written - I would like to fix that but really dont have the time right now)
